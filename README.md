# Hi 👋 I am Devang 
 


## Project Name : **Business Landing Page !**

While learning HTML and CSS I had learned about tables at that point in time it looked pretty useful turns it isn't used at all . I tried to use it in this project purposefully so that i do remember its implementation. This made me realise the importance of grids.
